\item I recover the directory of staff in Tokyo-Fu by digitizing historical documents of the institution's directory of staff. The directory contains information on the position, title, occupation, and wage of all the staff in a given year.

\item I combine a deep neural network trained on historical Japanese documents and propriety OCR software to digitize the documents (Figure 2). After detecting the candidate of names using the OCR, I apply a Named Entity Recognition algorithm to find the objects with names.
