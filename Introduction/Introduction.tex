\item Office spaces are sources of interactions that predict future career trajectories. 

\item The composition of offices determines the network of interactions but lacks academic attention. The analysis requires staff details with their positional details, but researchers cannot access such rich data easily.

\item I investigate the effect of office composition on future career trajectories by drawing on a historical database of a large public institution.

\item I estimate the impact of different office compositions by leveraging a change in office composition accruing from military drafting.

\item I find workers from offices with any co-workers drafted out tend to stay at the institution longer than others. I hypothesize that smaller offices led to more interactions among workers, increasing their chances of getting offered promotions for the institution to retain them.

\item I find the skill composition of offices matters for retention.
